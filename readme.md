# Auto BG Assist

Basic AddOn for World of Warcraft *(TBCC)* to automatically enable 'Assist Everyone' in Battelground.

Features:
- [x] Auto Join Battelgrounds*
- [x] Auto Assist Everyone *(if leader)*

The idea is to make everyone automatically assisant in the BG group as this will improve the quality of the BG.

To be able to assist everyone, you need to be group leader.

#### How to become group leader?

From my experience the first players that joins the BG instance will become leader, however when a new player joins you might lose your leadeship *(this seem random?)*

This AddOn allows you to nearly instantly join a BG instance, increasing the change of being the leader.
Additionally it will automatically set the 'Assist Everyone' nearly instantly so that you dont have to worry about losing your leadeship once another player joins.

**Please spread the word,** as I am tired of `/w` people asking for assist!

## How To Use

Create a new folder named `AutoBG` at `World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns\` and move the files into there.
